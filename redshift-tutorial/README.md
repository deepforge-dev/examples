# Redshift Tutorial

This collection of Deepforge projects provides an example of how to build and use a project centered around using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify or analyze astronomical images. In this example, the analysis is focused on predicting [cosmological redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) using a simplified version of the approach used in [Pasquet et. al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06607).

The Redshift-Application project provides a collection of potentially useful pipelines for a user that wants to create and utilize a redshift estimator. This project may be useful as a starting point for more specialized projects. More in depth descriptions of the available pipelines can be found [here](https://deepforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/redshift.html).

The Redshift-Tutorial project contains a sequence of increasingly complex example pipelines that provide guidance on how to build a project from scratch. This project is geared toward new users of the deepforge framework and has an accompanying written tutorial, which can be found [here](https://deepforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/rs-tutorial.html).
