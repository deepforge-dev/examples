# DeepForge example projects
This repository contains example projects for DeepForge v2. For legacy DeepForge examples, check out the [v1 branch](https://github.com/deepforge-dev/examples/tree/v1.x).

## Loading Examples
First, you will need to clone the project locally:

```
    git clone https://github.com/deepforge-dev/examples
```

If you do not have a deployment of deepforge handy, you can quickly spin up one using `docker-compose`:
```
    $ cd examples
    $ docker-compose up
```
After that, DeepForge can be used from the browser at http://localhost:8888.

**Note**: Further instruction on deployment can be accessed [here](https://deepforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest
/deployment/quick_start.html). 


Then you can load examples into DeepForge as follows:

1. Select "Import Project"
2. Name the new project
3. Select the file to import
4. Click "Create" to create a new project from the example!
